Now I have a custom image data set with only two camera perspectives, one front and one back. one named front.mp4 and the other named back.mp4.

I want you write a python script to extract frames from these two videos and save them as images in a folder named custom-data.
The dataset is structured like below:
custom-data
├── front
| ├──1.png
| ├──2.png
| ├──...
├── back
| ├──1.png
| ├──2.png
| ├──...
